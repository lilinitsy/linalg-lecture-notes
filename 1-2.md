# 1.2: Lengths and Dot Products
(Note: Github doesn't seem to be displaying the markdown completely perfectly; for optimal viewing, I suggest using VS Code and the Markdown All in One extension, since that's what this was formatted against).

We can do more than just add vectors and multiply them by scalars; individual vectors can have a sort of multiplication element to them as well, called the **dot product**. If we have a vector $v = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 & v_2 \end{bmatrix}$ and $w = \begin{bmatrix} w_1 & w_2 \end{bmatrix}$, then the dot product is $v * w = v_1 * w_1 + v_2 * w_2$. Notice that this produces a **single value,** and that $v * w = w * v$. Generalized:

$$v * w = v_1 w_1 + ... + v_n w_n$$

Try computing the dot products of these vectors. Draw out all the vectors as well:

1. $v = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, w = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 2\end{bmatrix}$
2. $v = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 \end{bmatrix}, w = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2\end{bmatrix}$
3. $v = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, w = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2\end{bmatrix}$
4. $v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, w = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$


We can notice that some of these products come out to 0. When a dot product is 0, it means that the two vectors that were dotted together are perpendicular; they meet at a 90 degree angle (perpendicular). 

We may also wish to know what the *length* of a vector $v$ is. To compute this, we can dot a vector with itself. So:

$$length = ||v|| = \sqrt{v * v} = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + ... + v_n^2}$$

You can practice trying to take the length of any of the vectors listed above.

A **unit vector** is a vector that has a length of 1. We can make any vector into a unit vector by normalizing it: Dividing all components of the vector by its length. 

$$Normalization: u = \frac{v}{||v||}$$

For example, if $v = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$, then we would compute $length_v = \sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{17}$. So, $u = $v = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{4}{\sqrt{17}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{17}} \end{bmatrix}$. If $v * w = 0$, then $u * w$ when $u$ is the unit vector of $v$ will still be 0.
