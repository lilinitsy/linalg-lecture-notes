# 1.2: Lengths and Dot Products
(Note: Github doesn't seem to be displaying the markdown completely perfectly; for optimal viewing, I suggest using VS Code and the Markdown All in One extension, since that's what this was formatted against).

We can do more than just add vectors and multiply them by scalars; individual vectors can have a sort of multiplication element to them as well, called the **dot product**. If we have a vector $v = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 & v_2 \end{bmatrix}$ and $w = \begin{bmatrix} w_1 & w_2 \end{bmatrix}$, then the dot product is $v * w = v_1 * w_1 + v_2 * w_2$. Notice that this produces a **single value,** and that $v * w = w * v$. Generalized:

$$v * w = v_1 w_1 + ... + v_n w_n$$

Try computing the dot products of these vectors. Draw out all the vectors as well:

1. $v = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, w = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 2\end{bmatrix}$
2. $v = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 2 \end{bmatrix}, w = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2\end{bmatrix}$
3. $v = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, w = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2\end{bmatrix}$
4. $v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, w = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$


We can notice that some of these products come out to 0. When a dot product is 0, it means that the two vectors that were dotted together are perpendicular; they meet at a 90 degree angle (perpendicular). 

We may also wish to know what the *length* of a vector $v$ is. To compute this, we can dot a vector with itself. So:

$$length = ||v|| = \sqrt{v * v} = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + ... + v_n^2}$$

You can practice trying to take the length of any of the vectors listed above.

A **unit vector** is a vector that has a length of 1. We can make any vector into a unit vector by normalizing it: Dividing all components of the vector by its length. 

$$Normalization: u = \frac{v}{||v||}$$

For example, if $v = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$, then we would compute $length_v = \sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{17}$. So, $u = $v = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{4}{\sqrt{17}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{17}} \end{bmatrix}$. If $v * w = 0$, then $u * w$ when $u$ is the unit vector of $v$ will still be 0.

Now we can do an interesting proof based on some of this information. When we have perpendicular vectors such that $v * w = 0$, then we also can notice that we might be forming two sides of a right triangle. We know that:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

Given that $v = \begin{bmatrix} v1 & v2 \end{bmatrix}$ and $w = \begin{bmatrix} w1 & w2 \end{bmatrix}$, we have:

$$||v||^2 + ||w^2|| = ||v - w||^2$$

$$ (v_1^2 + v_2^2) + (w_1^2 + w_2^2) = (v_1 - w_1)^2 + (v_2 - w_2)^2$$

Working this out on paper, we can see that this reduces to

$$0 = v_1 w_1 + v_2 w_2$$

And so, we can conclude with certainty that when $v * w = 0$, the vectors are perpendicular; the angle between them is 90 degrees.

Thought question: Is the zero vector $v = 0$ perpendicular to every other vector?

We can calculate angles for $v * w$ when it's not 0 either. We instantly know that $v * w$ is more than 90 degrees if the dot product is negative, and less than 90 degrees if the dot product is positive. We can sketch this to see.

Try computing the dot products with $v = [1 0]$ and the following w's: $w = [0 1], w = [1 1], w = [-1 1]

If the dot product is not zero, then $||v||^2 + ||w^2|| = ||v - w||^2$ does not hold true. If we have two *unit vectors*, v and w (Strang calls them u and U which I find a bit confusing), then:

$$ v * w = cos(\theta)$$


Why wouldn't we be able to get the angle if the vectors aren't all normalized? In that case, we would need to divide the vectors by their length, giving us the full...

### Cosine Formula
$$ \frac{v * w}{||v|| * ||w||} = cos(\theta)$$
Since it is normalized, the absolute value of this dot product will always be between -1 and 1, inclusive; this fact gives us two more inequalities:

### Schwarz Inequality
$$|v * w| <= ||v|| * ||w||$$

and the...

### Triangle Inequality
$$||v + w|| <= ||v|| + ||w||$$
