# Linear Algebra (Strang 1.1) Lecture Notes
First, we should introduce what we're dealing with. In this class, we deal with *vectors* and *matrices*. Matrices structures that have *rows* and *columns*. The number of rows goes vertically along the matrix, and the number of columns goes horizontally. In the matrix M = $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6\end{bmatrix}$, there are 2 rows and 3 columns. A vector is a matrix that has either 1 row or 1 column, and any number of elements in the corresponding dimension. This first chapter will primarily deal with vectors. $v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$ is a row vector of dimension `1x3` (1 row, 3 columns), and v = $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$ is a column vector of dimension `3x1` (3 rows, 1 column). `1` is the first component of v in this column matrix; `2` is the second component; `3` is the third. If v = $\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3\end{bmatrix}$, then v1 is the first component, v2 is the second, and v3 is the third.



Strang states that:
```
The heart of linear algebra is in two operations - both with vectors. We add vectors to get `v + w`. We multiply them by numbers c + d to get `cv` and `dw`. Combining these operations (adding cv to dw) gives the linear combination cv + dw.
```

That is, we want to add vectors together in some way, and multiply by them by some scalar value. Any combination of this sort gives us a *linear combination*. For example, if we say:

let $v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\1 \end{bmatrix}$, and let $w = \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$, we can add these two vectors together with any set of scalars $c$ and $d$ . If $c$ and $d$ are both 1, then $cv + dw$ = $1 * \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\1 \end{bmatrix} + 1 * \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 6 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$. If c or d or both were something else, the linear combination could come out to a different result.

Try coming up with linear combinations when $c = 2, 3$ and $d = 2, 3$ (so 4 linear combinations). What type of results do you get? Graph them. What shape does this seem to produce?

## Generalized Vector Operations
Vector addition: Using column vectors, let v = $\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}$ and w = $\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2\end{bmatrix}$; then, $v + w = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 + w_1 \\ v_2 + w_2 \end{bmatrix}$. 

Using row vectors: let v = $\begin{bmatrix} v_1 && v_2 \end{bmatrix}$ and w = $\begin{bmatrix} w_1 & w_2\end{bmatrix}$; then, $v + w = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 + w_1 & v_2 + w_2 \end{bmatrix}$

We can also scale these vectors. If we let v = $\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}$, then $cv$ where $c = 2$ would be $2v = \begin{bmatrix} 2v_1 \\ 2v_2 \end{bmatrix}$. Additionally, we can scale however we want$-v = -1v = \begin{bmatrix} -v_1 \\ -v_2 \end{bmatrix}$. Keep in mind that if we drew a line through all these scaled vectors, the same line that goes through $2v$ would also go through $-v$ and any $cv$ we can come up with.

Combining these operations, we can get to any point across the line that $v$ spans by scaling it by some $c$. Similarily, we can get to any point across the line that $w$ spans by scaling it by some $d$. What if we combine any $cv + dw$? What shape can be produced by that?


Importantly, we can also come up with the *zero vector*. $0v$ = $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$, since multiplying anything by zero is still zero, and this extends to the components of $v$ as well.

## Practice with vector operations in 2D
1. Given $v = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}$, $w = \begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{bmatrix}$, and $u = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \end{bmatrix}$, compute $v + w + u$.
2. Given $v = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}$, $w = \begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{bmatrix}$, and $u = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3\end{bmatrix}$, compute $v + w + u$.

## Vectors in 3+ dimensions
Vectors can span however many dimensions we please. $v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$, if scaled by some $c$, would still give us points along a line that is pointing in the direction of $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$. However, what if we added it to a second vector, $w = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$? Try coming up with a way to get the vector $w = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ -1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

Without computation, we can see that there is no possible way to come up with this. But, we can see that $0v + 0w$ would still go through the origin. If we tried some combination of $c = 2, 3, d = 2, 3$ to scale $v$ and $w$, we might see that we actually sketch a *plane* when computing $v + w$. Thus, for independent vectors $v$ and $w$, $cv + dw$ can span a plane through the origin, just as a combination $cv$ can span a line through the origin. Adding a third independent vector would give us a *volume* in 3D space, thus filling the whole space; every possible point in 3D space would be attainable from some combination of $v, w$, and $u$.

## Practice with vector operations in 3D
1. Given $v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$ and $w = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}$, what combinations can be produced from any $cv + dw$? How come this is the case? What if only 1 element in either vector were changed?
